        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Some ideas can sound a little wacky and out-there, but once put into practice, just make perfect sense. This is one of them - the chicken katsu pizza: the place where Japan meets Italy in a head-on collision and the result is... totally delicious!</p>
            <p>Beautiful breadcrumbed chicken, a light, fruity curry sauce, creamy mozzarella and fresh coriander, all on a low-calorie Lo-Dough pizza base. Trust us, it works... bigtime. </p>
    
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 piece of Lo-Dough</li>
            <li>Half a ball of (half fat) mozzarella, sliced into thin rounds</li>
            <li>75g of katsu chicken</li>
            <li>50g of katsu curry sauce</li>
            <li>15g of red onion, finely sliced</li>
            <li>A few sprigs of fresh coriander</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 250Â°C/475F/Gas 9</li>
            <li>Spoon the curry sauce onto your Lo-Dough, making sure to spread it right to the edge.</li>
            <li>Add the mozzarella on top, distributing as evenly as possible. Then add your katsu chicken and onion, in an even spread.</li>
            <li>Bake in your oven for 7-10 minutes, or until golden and bubbling. Dress with a little extra sauce and a few sprigs of coriander and serve straight away.</li>
        </ol>
